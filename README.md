# RejuviFy - Cloud Computing Documentation

## Diagram Architecture
Our application architecture is shown in the picture below. We use Cloud Run, Cloud Storage, and Cloud SQL services to support our application to run. So, the frontend will consume the API from two servers; Backend and Machine Learning models. For the Backend, it will directly connect to Cloud SQL as a database. For the Machine Learning models, it will directly connect to Cloud Storage to store the analyzed images from the user and to Cloud SQL as a database. We put these services in asia-southeast2 region.
